This template serves as the base template for all OpenShift MAZ Setup provisioner templates.
It provides all essential libraries and development tools needed to
successfully provisions a small OpenShift environment (1 master, x app nodes) that
is suitable for demos, POCs and small workshops.

To use this template as a base template, you need to have 's2i/bin' directory in the
same directory as your packer template JSON file. This directory should contain S2I
scripts.

This base template also provides the default user you should use to run your
provisioner. Your JSON file should include this instruction after you finish
installing software:

USER default

The default directory for installing your provisioner sources is
'/opt/app-root/src' and the WORKDIR and HOME for the 'default' user is set
to this directory as well. In your S2I scripts, you don't have to use absolute
path, but rather rely on the relative path.
